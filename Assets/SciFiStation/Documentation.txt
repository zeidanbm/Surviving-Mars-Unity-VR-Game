This packages contains three scripts:
-Door.cs
-FlashingLight.cs
-Mill_rotate.cs


========================================
Door.cs
========================================

This script takes care of opening and closing of doors.
It needs to be placed on a gameobject. That gameobject must have a boxcollider with "isTrigger" switched on. When this collider is triggered, the doors will open.
The script has the following parameters:
*DoorSpeed: The speed with which the doors will open/close.
*CloseAfterSeconds: The doors will close automatically after the number of seconds entered here.
*LeftDoor: The gameobject that represents the left door.
*RightDoor: The gameobject that represents the right door.
*MoveDistance: The distance the doors will slide. A door with a width of 1 should have the value 1 here.

The GameObject that this script is attached to should also have an audiosource. The file in this source will be played when the door opens or closes.

========================================
FlashingLight.cs
========================================
This is a simple script that takes a lightsource as parameter.
The only other parameter is the FlashSpeed. The lightsource will be switched on and off in the frequency of the given lightspeed

========================================
Mill_Rotate.cs
========================================
This script takes care of the rotating of the windmills.
It takes one parameter: speed. This is the rotatingspeed of the wings of the mill.

If you have any questions about these scripts, or anout anything else in this packages, please contact me via info@devjockeys.com.

Enjoy!
